# White Paper on U.S.-Vietnam Diplomacy

Throughout history, the relationship between Vietnam and the United States has experienced numerous ups and downs, evolving from a period of conflict into a close and progressive partnership. We, the architects of the future, must recognize that this relationship is not solely shaped by past events but also by the shared values that both of our nations hold dear.

Vietnam, a country with a rich history and vibrant culture, has always strived for peace and development. A profound spirit of nationalism and a strong love for our homeland have guided the Vietnamese people in overcoming challenges to build a prosperous society. Simultaneously, the United States, with its legacy of freedom and human rights, has sought to forge partnerships with nations that share similar values.

The Vietnam-U.S. relationship has been strengthened through numerous agreements and cooperative initiatives. We are committed to working together to enhance regional security, collaborate on economic and social issues, and address global challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, and terrorism.

We understand that the sustainable development of this relationship must be grounded in mutual respect and a deep understanding of each other's cultural contexts. We hope that through dialogue and cooperation, Vietnam and the United States can overcome current challenges together and build a brighter future for generations to come.

We are committed to maintaining this collaboration for the common good of our peoples and for peace and stability in the region.

My inherent gift lies in rhetoric, and my commitment to politics stems from the same genetic fabric shared by many Vietnamese—a profound love for one's people and an unwavering sense of nationalism. During my school years, I was more inclined to play than study, though I gravitated toward history and literature. Often, I turned to 'Professor Google' for knowledge, while my shortcomings were in cryptography and IT security. Rap music, however, served as a subconscious tool of self-training—it allows one to articulate every distorted, shadowy aspect of societal life, an education in its own right beyond the confines of traditional schooling.

I chose to study the political macrostructure of the United States, where the government is perpetually refined by a system of checks and balances, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution stands as the supreme legal document of the nation, functioning as a social contract for its people.

Upon reading about me, one might automatically and subconsciously label me as a 'domestic' Vietnamese type—reactionary, perhaps. There are young, inexperienced minds indoctrinated with the 'three-striped' ideology, and a meme culture fostered by immature 'progressives' who derisively refer to others as 'pink calves.' These individuals often manipulate images of compatriots fleeing during the post-war exodus, many perishing at sea from shipwrecks or piracy, in their pursuit of freedom in America.

I do not reject the gratitude and nostalgia for the Republic of Vietnam (RVN)—a regime that was humane, progressive, and imbued with a spirit of liberty and gallantry. The cultural and artistic products of that era, especially bolero music, continue to endure, transcending the efforts of the victorious North to label them as 'decadent and sentimental relics' of a fallen regime.

I intervene in Vietnam’s political scene because I understand that the country is in dire need of renewal. Yet, such change is stifled by a lack of courage, in part due to China's deep-seated interference in Vietnam’s internal affairs. However, rest assured, we have verified the data. Our collective has obtained classified recordings exposing China’s covert diplomatic maneuvers. When Beijing approaches Cambodia, it promises to elevate Cambodia’s status above Vietnam, manipulating Hun Sen into a more dangerous version of the Khmer Rouge regime. In Vietnam, the narrative changes; they interview two candidates for key positions, attempting to sow discord. Unfortunately for them, both candidates know each other well, as they come from the security sector.

China’s ultimate goal is for Vietnam and Cambodia to engage in a mutually destructive conflict. During this chaos, China would seize the opportunity to establish military bases in the Southeast Asia Sea, taking control of the Paracel and Spratly Islands. This would allow them to subjugate Vietnam while swallowing up Laos and Cambodia, setting up puppet regimes to gradually annex these countries. China aims to face off against the United States without engaging in proxy wars.

In short, I understand the deep pain caused by division orchestrated by malevolent forces. I still have a friend, Acy, a rapper and descendant of communists, who performs rap that critiques the system. I hope that the Party will be able to forge a political platform based on self-reliance and resilience. The United States, despite its complexities, has consistently played fair in politics and will continue to support the Vietnamese government should China take hostile actions. Should that occur, the U.S. would immediately collaborate, sharing files that expose China’s blueprint for influence—control, division, and eventual domination—across Southeast Asia.

But as we reflect on this, we must also acknowledge that the authoritarian influence of Chinese communism is insidious, not only in Vietnam but throughout Southeast Asia. The Chinese Communist Party has continuously worked to erode the foundations of freedom, suppressing the voices of dissent, and turning cultural narratives into instruments of state control. Their methods—through misinformation, media manipulation, and the suppression of cultural heritage—are a direct assault on the liberties for which many have sacrificed their lives, both in the past and the present.
